# Web Portfolio
Web Portfolio is a dynamic, lightweight, and personalized web application based on the Django framework that showcases your projects and skills. This project, a modification of the Strata template by HTML5 UP, leverages the power of Django to create a customizable, data-driven portfolio page. Visitors can see my projects, skills, certificates, and other details to the application, which are then dynamically rendered on the portfolio page.
